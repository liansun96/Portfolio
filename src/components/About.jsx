        My journey into the world of web development began with a fascination
        for how technology can transform ideas into interactive and beautiful
        web interfaces. Over the years, I've honed my skills to not only meet
        the industry's best practices but also to stay ahead of the
        ever-evolving web landscape. <br />
        <br />
        In my spare time, I engage in activities such as playing the guitar,
        reading, and working on personal coding projects when I'm not coding.{" "}
